# Beachcomber

Beachcomber is a minesweeper clone made with React.

You a beachcomber on the hunt for treasure! You can dig to try to find some hints, but don't reveal the treasure now while the beach is full, put a flag on all of the treasure you find so you can come back for it later. Right click to place a flag or click the flag/reveal toggle at the top-right. Good luck!
